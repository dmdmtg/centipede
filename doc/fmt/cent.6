	  cccceeeennnnttttiiiippppeeeeddddeeee is a game designed to run in a layer on either the
	  blit or the 5620 Dot Mapped Display terminal.	It makes use
	  of the mouse connected to these terminals to control the
	  player's icon	and to shoot at	other objects that appear on
	  the screen.

	  The program is downloaded to the terminal using 68ld for the
	  blit or 32ld for the 5620. The screen	should then say:
			       C E N T I P E D E
			     Hit any key to start.
	  When you hit a key, you will then have control of a icon
	  looking a little like	a flatworm that	appears	on the screen.
	  The icon is moved by moving the mouse. The middle button is
	  used to shoot	a missile upwards. Only	one missile may	be on
	  the screen at	a time.	The middle button may be held down to
	  shoot	the missile as quickly as possible.

	  The game may be stopped at any time by typing	'q'. Also the
	  left and right buttons on the	mouse behave as	they normally
	  do and may be	used to	select other layers, create new
	  layers, etc.

	  In general, your icon	may not	bump into anything that	is
	  moving on the	screen without being killed. You are given
	  three	men at the beginning of	every game with	an extra man
	  awarded every	12000 points.

	  The following	are some of the	objects	that appear during the
	  course of the	game:

	  mmmmuuuusssshhhhrrrroooooooommmmssss (value: 1 point)
				  It takes four	shots to kill a
				  mushroom. Mushrooms merely deflect
				  the centipede.

	  cccceeeennnnttttiiiippppeeeeddddeeee (value: 10 points per segment (100 points for head))
				  The centipede	winds down the screen
				  by changing direction	whenever it
				  hits a mushroom or the edge of the
				  screen. Any segment of the centipede

				  you shoot will turn into a mushroom
				  and may cause	the centipede to split
				  into two smaller centipedes.

	  ssssppppiiiiddddeeeerrrr    (value: 300, 600 or	900 points)
				  The spider bounces around and	takes
				  away any mushrooms it	hits. The
				  closer you are to it when you	kill
				  it, the more points you get.

	  sssslllluuuugggg (value: 200 points)
				  The slug, also known as the flea,
				  will come down and drop new
				  mushrooms if there are too few on
				  the bottom of	the screen. You	must
				  shoot	the slug twice to kill it.

	  ssssccccoooorrrrppppiiiioooonnnn  (value: 1000) After	a while	the scorpion will zip
				  across the screen and	turn any
				  mushrooms it hits into smiley	faces.
				  When ever a centipede	segment	hits a
				  smiley faced mushroom	it will
				  plummet directly to the bottom of
				  the screen.
